**PixVote** is an online voting system that is - end to end - under the voters full control.  

PixVote is as easy to use as it is elegant and secure. 

By switching the color of an individually chosen, anonymous pixel of a public accessible graphics file, this prixel represents the vote of a deciated user always visible to him and to the public - however, the public not knowing which pixel belongs to whom.

So the system will always know WHO has voted, but not how as the only person who knows which pixel belongs to whom is the person that has switched this pixel. 

So - whenever date would be manipulated, the Pixvote system provides an alarm button the user can use and an intelligent fraud protection system (e.g. comparing votes/times rate patterns) that kicks in whenever somebody claims a potential security breach or hack. 

In the worst case, voters will be actively called for a revote. 

## The process

### Login and selecting a vote

After Login the user is displayed a list with his pending and already completed votes. 

### Current Vote status

After selection of a vote the user will see the public picture he/she can toggle between picture-mode (displayed as is) and vote mode (votes pixels show red or green status). 
Below the pictures the user will see the percentages of yes vs no votes and the percentage of votes taken vs. pending. 

### Voting

When the selected vote is still pending (the user has not voted yet) he/she might hoover over the pic that will display the underlaying pixels in a separate (magnification) window (the lense).
In the lense-Window the user might doubleclick on any free (not colored) pixel to open a dialogue window that will display the voting-text, the pixel's "coordination" data and a button to click yes or no.
When Clicked the so selected pixel will switch accordingly and the user will get an inpersonal confirmation number via eMail or Phone he/she has to insert on the selection screen. The combined lense-screen-copy with the selected pixel and the given in confirmation number will be stored in the form of an encripted file (that can uploaded and decoded into Pixvote again should this be required).  

A PixVote is saying yes or no to a question by selecting and toggling the color of a pixel of a public accessibel web-graphic: gren = yes, red = no. 

This selection - after an optional confirmation check - will be updated in real-time in the big picturte and therefore will become immediately visible to the public (or whoever has access to the current vote). 

This is an easy process 

It is up to the user to remember the position of his vote pixel and to keep it secret. 

## Benefits

**Voters** can always check whether his/her vote is still there and that it's status has not been changed. 

**Public** can follow voting status and coverage in real-time

In the rare situation, where the system is hacked, it can be relaunched on an alternative server and users will be called within seconds for a revote - which normally can be done within a week - whereas paper-voting need much longer preparation time with much more risks of re-failer. 

## Advantages

* Speed: One Klick is fast, updates are ubiquos in realtime.

* System does not know who has voted, but ensures that every registered user has only a single voting right, the user might use or not.
